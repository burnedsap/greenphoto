---

On one of my trips to Aldona, I stumbled up on a house that seemed to closed for a long time. It was half shrouded in the trees and wasn't very accessible. But the colours were interesting, so I decided to shoot it. Turns out its Errol Pires aunt's house-Mrs. Pinto.

Here's what the house looks like:
